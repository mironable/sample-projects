**Titanic dataset analysis**

In this project we analyse the Titanic passengers' dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Setup: Jupyter Notebook under Python 3.6, external libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Aim of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use foundations of Data Analysis for the import, study, and visualisation of the raw data in an easy-to-digest manner.

1. Import of raw data (.csv) and load into a Pandas dataframe
2. Data exploration - Set of questions to be answered.
3. Visualise to better understand and analyse the data.
